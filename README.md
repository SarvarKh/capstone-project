Ideas for the web app project

## Traveler
1. Traveler’s app to find suitable tours based on price, duration,
2. Potential clients who are willing to travel abroad.
3. It will help clients to save time and money: instead of visiting traveling agencies' offices to check their possible offers or by visiting each of their websites/social media channels, clients can use a single platform and set destination, budget, and duration. The platform will then find the best matching offers of agencies and show them to platform users.


## YourDelivery
1. YourDelivery app is online food / pharmacy delivery ordering service for your destination
2. For people who are not willing to waste their time bring those items by themselves or don’t have time to do so.
3. It will help clients to save time and money: instead of visiting groceries or pharmacies, clients can use a single platform and set a destination and order food/drugs. The platform or delivery man can charge customers once they confirm that received their order. Not all pharmacies or markets possess websites/social media channels to receive order and deliver items.


## SafePayment
1. SafePayment app is 3rd party payment system that holds the payment of customers until they confirm that they confirm that their order was completed.
2. Online shops or any other system that provides services online.
3. It will help companies to be more reliable to attract more customers by providing safe payment methods: customer orders some service, and makes payment: the amount will be transferred to the SafePayment system and will be held there until the customer confirms that their order was completed successfully.
